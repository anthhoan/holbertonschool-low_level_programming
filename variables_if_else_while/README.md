# C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, I learned how to work with arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. I also practiced:

* Declaring and defining variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`
* Using `if` and `if...else` statements
* Writing `while` loops
* Leveraging the `putchar` function to print characters without standard I/O libraries

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

**File:** `0-positive_or_negative.c`
A C program that determines whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

* A different number is generated every run
* Output format:

  ```
  [number] is positive
  [number] is zero
  [number] is negative
  ```

---

### 1. The last digit

**File:** `1-last_digit.c`
A C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.

* A different number is generated each run
* Output format:

  ```
  Last digit of [number] is [digit] and is greater than 5
  Last digit of [number] is [digit] and is 0
  Last digit of [number] is [digit] and is less than 6 and not 0
  ```

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

**File:** `2-print_alphabet.c`
Prints the alphabet in lowercase using only the `putchar` function (twice).

* Output: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

---

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

**File:** `3-print_alphabets.c`
Prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, using only `putchar` three times.

* Output: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`

---

### 4. alphABET

**File:** `4-print_alphabt.c`
Prints the lowercase alphabet except `q` and `e`, using only `putchar` twice.

* Output: `abcdfghijklmnoprstuvwxyz`

---

### 5. Numbers

**File:** `5-print_numbers.c`
Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

* Output: `0123456789`

---

### 6. Numberz

**File:** `6-print_numberz.c`
Same as task 5, but only uses `putchar` (twice) and no `char` variables.

---

### 7. Smile in the mirror

**File:** `7-print_tebahpla.c`
Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse using only `putchar` twice.

* Output: `zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba`

---

### 8. Hexadecimal

**File:** `8-print_base16.c`
Prints all numbers of base 16 (0â€“9, aâ€“f) in lowercase using only `putchar` three times.

* Output: `0123456789abcdef`

---

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success

**File:** `9-print_comb.c`
Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using only `putchar` four times and no `char` variables.

* Output: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`
