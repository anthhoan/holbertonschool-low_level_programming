# C - Hello, World üåç

In this project, I learned the basics of C programming, including how to compile code using `gcc`, how the `main` function serves as an entry point, and how to output text to the console using standard functions like `puts` and `printf`.

## Tasks üìÉ

### 0. Preprocessor

**File:** `0-preprocessor`
A Bash script that runs a C file (provided in the variable `$CFILE`) through the C preprocessor and saves the output in a file named `c`.

### 1. Compiler

**File:** `1-compiler`
A Bash script that compiles a C file (saved in `$CFILE`) into an object file without linking.

* Output file: Same name as input but with a `.o` extension
  **Example:** `main.c` ‚Üí `main.o`

### 2. Assembler

**File:** `2-assembler`
A Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C file (saved in `$CFILE`).

* Output file: Same name as input but with a `.s` extension
  **Example:** `main.c` ‚Üí `main.s`

### 3. Name

**File:** `3-name`
A Bash script that compiles a C file (saved in `$CFILE`) and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

### 4. Hello, puts

**File:** `4-puts.c`
A C program that prints the following line using the `puts` function:

```
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"
```

### 5. Hello, printf

**File:** `5-printf.c`
A C program that prints the following line using the `printf` function:

```
with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,
```

### 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation

**File:** `6-size.c`
A C program that prints the sizes of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
